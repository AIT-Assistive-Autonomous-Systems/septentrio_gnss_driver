// Boost includes
#include <boost/foreach.hpp>
// In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious -->
// BOOST_FOREACH(char ch, "Hello World")
#include <boost/function.hpp>
// E.g. boost::function<int(const char*)> f = std::atoi;defines a pointer f that can
// point to functions that expect a parameter of type const char* and return a value
// of type int Generally, any place in which a function pointer would be used to
// defer a call or make a callback, Boost.Function can be used instead to allow the
// user greater flexibility in the implementation of the target.
#include <boost/thread.hpp>
// Boost's thread enables the use of multiple threads of execution with shared data
// in portable C++ code. It provides classes and functions for managing the threads
// themselves, along with others for synchronizing data between the threads or
// providing separate copies of data specific to individual threads.
#include <boost/thread/condition.hpp>
#include <boost/tokenizer.hpp>
// The tokenizer class provides a container view of a series of tokens contained in a
// sequence, e.g. if you are not interested in non-words...
#include <boost/algorithm/string/join.hpp>
// Join algorithm is a counterpart to split algorithms. It joins strings from a
// 'list' by adding user defined separator.
#include <boost/date_time/posix_time/posix_time.hpp>
// The class boost::posix_time::ptime that we will use defines a location-independent
// time. It uses the type boost::gregorian::date, yet also stores a time.
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
// Boost.Asio may be used to perform both synchronous and asynchronous operations on
// I/O objects such as sockets.
#include <boost/asio/serial_port.hpp>
#include <boost/bind.hpp>
